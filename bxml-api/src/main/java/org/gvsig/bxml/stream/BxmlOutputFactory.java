/**
 * Defines a factory to create {@link BxmlStreamWriter} instances settled up with the factory's
 * {@link EncodingOptions encoding options}.
 * <p>
 * A {@code BxmlStreamWriter} can be created out of an ordinary {@code OutputStream} or a
 * destination {@code File}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * {@code BxmlOutputFactory} instances are stateful. Its sole state is meant to be an instance of
 * {@link EncodingOptions}, which determines the encoding preferences the {@link BxmlStreamWriter}s
 * created by the factory will operate with. Yet externally modifying the state of the {@code
 * EncodingOptions} object used to alter this factory state shall not actually alter the factory
 * state. EncodingOptions are mutable for the sake of simplicity using this API, though
 * implementations shall use a safe copy internally or other way of ensuring information hiding.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * {@code BxmlOutputFactory} instances are required to be <b>thread safe</b> in order to support
 * reuse by client code. Yet, the {@link BxmlStreamWriter}s a factory creates are NOT thread safe
 * and it's up to the client code to handle concurrent access, though concurrent access to a stream
 * is highly discouraged.
 * </p>
