/**
 * Enumeration that defines the type-identification codes for the various token types.
 * <p>
 * Tokens are used to encode the content of the BXML file in discrete "packets" that correspond
 * roughly to XML markups.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <h3>Elements and Attributes</h3>
 * Elements and attribute definitions are split into the pieces that normally represent nodes in a
 * tree representation of an XML document. The element and attribute definitions are modeled after
 * the WAP-XML representation. An element starts with one of: {@link #EmptyElement},
 * {@link #EmptyAttrElement}, {@link #ContentElement}, or {@link #ContentAttrElement}. The type of
 * token identifies whether there are attributes or content present within the element. The
 * least-significant two bits of the code value can be used to identify whether the content
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <h3>Content Representation</h3>
 * Several token types are used to represent various types of literal XML content. A content segment
 * of XML may be represented by any sequence and combination of these content tokens. The validity
 * of a sequence of content tokens within a BXML file is defined as the validity of the textual
 * equivalent to the tokens as it would appear in textual XML relative to the content-type
 * definition in XML-Schema or other definition languages. It is recognized that <i>the ideal
 * processing environment</i> for BXML is one in which <i>binary content is passed directly from
 * generator to parser to application</i> without ever being translated into text in between.
 * Therefore, it is recommended that the XML parser scan and store equivalent structures to the
 * content tokens defined in this section and that it avoid translating numbers and "blobs" into a
 * textual equivalent if at all possible in passing the content information to the reading
 * application.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * NOTE: the documentation to explain the semantics of these tokens is extracted and adapted when
 * needed from the section 8.4 of the BXML spec, version 0.0.8.

     * (e.g., as an element name and as an attribute name). Also, each symbol string must be defined
     * in the BXML stream before it is first referenced when the token stream is read sequentially;
