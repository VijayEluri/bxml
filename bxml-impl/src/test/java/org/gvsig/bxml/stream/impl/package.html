<h3>Unit Tests Suite</h3>

<p>Unit tests are written from a programmer's perspective to test
the behavor of software components in isolation. They ensure that a
particular method of a class successfully performs a set of specific
tasks. Each test confirms that a method produces the expected output
when given a known input.</p>
